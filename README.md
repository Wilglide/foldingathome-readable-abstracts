# Folding at home scientific papers with plain english abstract

Discord of Folding@Home at https://discordapp.com/invite/97Z2wBF

Clearly, this is my first open source project, so please be nice :)

The idea is to get plain english readable abstracts from https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/

Everyone can contribute, certainly also system biologists, chemists, physicist and computer scientists.

To do:
1) Put some demo paraphrased abstracts in this repo
2) Get people involved
3) Think about building a scraper
4) Think about building a wiki
5) Thinks about integrating it all
6) Quality control?

Bonus: Get Randall Munroe from xkcd.com involved somehow ;) He is good at making plain english translations.
Maybe we can even make a dictionary / thesaurus of complicated scientific terms that can replace in place. He has done that before.
